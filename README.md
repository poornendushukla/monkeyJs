## Overview

MonkeyJs is a lightweight, customizable product tour library that helps you create interactive guided tours for your web applications. It's designed to be framework-agnostic, with dedicated implementations for both vanilla TypeScript (`monkeyts`) and React (`react-monkeyjs`).

### Key Features:

- **Framework Agnostic**: Core functionality works with any JavaScript framework
- **React Integration**: Dedicated React components with hooks and context providers
- **Customizable UI**: Flexible theming and styling options
- **Step-by-Step Tours**: Guide users through your application with interactive popovers
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple API for defining tour steps and behaviors

MonkeyJs makes it easy to onboard new users, highlight new features, or provide contextual help within your application.

## Why another touring library?

I developed this library with a strong emphasis on code readability and maintainability. While there are thousands of other libraries offering similar features, MonkeyJs stands out due to its highly modular and extensible codebase. Our approach ensures that developers can easily understand, extend, and contribute new features, making it an ideal choice for collaborative and long-term projects.
